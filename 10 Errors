How to perform exception handling??
1) Hit the exception 
2) Throw the exception 
3) Catch the exception 
4) Perform the corrective action 

try()= This block contains the code in which we put the code that might contain the exception 
Catch()= whenever some exception is found in try block it is immediately thrown to catch block now the catch block will have the responsibility to handle the exception 
   - Whenever try block finishes then only catch comes. 

Note: there can be multiple catch block for 1 try block and single catch block can handle multiple exceptions
