// STATIC DATA MEMBER 

// It is initialized to zero whenever the first object of its class is created. No other initialisation is permitted
// For making any data member static we use static keyword
// Only one copy of static data members is created and shared by all
// Itâ€™s visibility is entire program 
// USAGE= Static data members in C++ are used when a piece of data needs to be shared among all instances of a class, or when a class-level variable is required that exists independently of any object instantiation.

// STATIC MEMBER FUNCTION
// Use static data member only accessing other variable will throw error 
// Static data member or static data function both are not a part of any object
// Since it is not a part of any object it is called using class name.
