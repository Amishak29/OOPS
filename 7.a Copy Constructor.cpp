//A copy constructor is a special type of constructor in object-oriented programming that creates a new object as a copy of an existing object. It is typically used when an object is passed by value or returned by value, allowing a new instance of the object to be created as an exact copy of the original one.

// In many programming languages, the copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same type as a parameter and creates a new object with the same values as the original object.
